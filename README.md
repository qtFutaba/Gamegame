-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Developed by: Caiden Clement, Ash Frazer, Zach Brown, and Axel Pinard.

  In order to please: Dr. Baarsch, professor of Software Development in Java at UCA.

The key features of the game include:

Character creation - Choose a class, and name your adventurer.

Battle - Players will proceed through a gauntlet of increasingly difficult battles with a variety of enemies, from a simple minded Goblin to a fearsome Knight warrior.

Improve - As you succeed in battles, you will obtain coins, which can be exchanged for powerful artifacts to increase your abilities and fight in new ways.

(Let's be honest, it's not *that* impressive but it's a cool project anyways.)

Brave adventurer, do you have what it takes to brave The Dungeons of Caza?

(You probably do, it's not that hard.)
